I built this site using modern development tools (bootstrap, gulp, bower, node). 
Note the comment at the top which will lead you to a page where you can read more about these development tools.
The app subdirectory contains source files which can be viewed for grading.
To view the website please navigate to the dist subdirectory. The files in the dist subdirectory will not be very readable since gulp has minified/uglified them for distribution. As mentioned above, please use the app directory to view source files.
